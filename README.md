🕵️ OSINT Runner (Beginner Edition)

A beginner-friendly OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) framework script that helps security researchers, ethical hackers, and learners perform basic reconnaissance.
It combines WHOIS Lookup, Subdomain Enumeration, Directory Enumeration, and a Port Scanner (mini-Naabu) into one simple tool.

This is just the first version — lightweight, educational, and easy to understand. Over time, it will evolve into a more advanced OSINT toolkit. Contributions are welcome! 🚀

📌 Features
✅ WHOIS Lookup – get domain registration details
✅ Subdomain Enumeration – discover hidden subdomains using a wordlist
✅ Directory Enumeration – brute-force hidden directories on a target website
✅ Mini Naabu (Port Scanner) – quickly scan common ports of an IP
✅ Report Generation – all results are automatically saved to osint_report.txt

⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Rohit-Sahani/OSINT.git
cd osint-runner

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


(Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed)
▶️ Usage
Run the script:
python osint_runner.py


You will be prompted for:
A domain (for WHOIS lookup & subdomain enumeration)
A target URL (for directory enumeration)
Wordlists (default: sub_wordlist.txt, dir_wordlist.txt)
An IP address (for port scanning)


Example run:

Enter domain for WHOIS lookup (example.com) : google.com
Enter target URL for directory enumeration (https://example.com) : https://testphp.vulnweb.com
Enter subdomain wordlist file [default: sub_wordlist.txt]: 
Enter directory wordlist file [default: dir_wordlist.txt]: 
Enter IP for port scan : 192.168.1.1


Output will be shown on screen and saved in osint_report.txt.

Important: Make sure that all the required files and modules — including whois_lookup.py, subdomain.py, dir_enum.py, mini_naabu.py, and the wordlists (sub_wordlist.txt and dir_wordlist.txt) — are in the same folder as osint_runner.py. This ensures the framework runs correctly and can access all dependencies.
